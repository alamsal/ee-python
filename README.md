# ee-python
This repository holds scripts related to running Google Earth Engine using a Python API

To run these scripts successfully, make sure you are in the ee-python environment (Python 2.7, ipython notebooks 2.0, and some other stuff). Also make sure that the notebooks have been stored in the correct format. If you open them in your root directory, it will automatically upgrade the version and they will no longer run in the ee-python environment for which they were built.
